# Machine_Learning_with_AutoGluon
## AutoGluon is an open source Python package, which helps you build Auto ML models!

I think that's all the intro it needs. I recently bumped into this new python package called AutoGluon, it helps in not only Auto ML process but hell lot more!

In this repo, I will be introducing this library and it's one of many features - Classification.

For this I am using our very beloved Titanic Dataset.

But taking few steps back, how to install this library? Well the answer is very simple - **pip install autogluon**

But this is a very large package and I recommend installing only the one's which you will need. For me, I just installed the **Tabular Prediction** package.

I have attached jupyter notebook code, which shows a step by step all the process i have done to create a good model.
